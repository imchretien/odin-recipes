    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chili con carne - 'con carne' is Spanish for 'with meat' - is a real Tex-Mex dish, which originated in Texas and... without beans! We have one that does contain beans. Tex-Mex with a touch of the Netherlands.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients (4 Servings)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Medium-sized Onions</li>
        <li>3 Garlic Cloves</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Sunflower Oil</li>
        <li>500g Ground Beef</li>
        <li>2 tsp Paprika Powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp Ground Cumin</li>
        <li>2 tsp Dried Oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp Onion Powder</li>
        <li>0,5 tsp Ground Cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 Red Bell Peppers</li>
        <li>400g Canned Black Beans</li>
        <li>400g Canned Kidney Beans</li>
        <li>800g Canned Peeled Tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Chipotle Pepper in Adobo Sauce</li>
        <li>200 ml Water</li>
        <li>1 Chicken Stock Cube</li>
        <li>50g Pure Chocolate 70%</li>
        <li>1 tsp Brown Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the onions and finely chop the garlic. Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the minced meat with the spices and possibly salt for 5-6 minutes on medium to high heat until brown. Sear the meat thoroughly by frying it a little longer on one side and pressing it a little occasionally. The meat does not have to be cooked equally everywhere. The browner pieces provide more flavor.</li>
        <li>Clean the bell peppers and cut into pieces of approximately 1 cm.</li>
        <li>Add the onion and bell peppers and fry for 3 minutes over medium heat. Add the garlic and fry for 2 minutes. Stir regularly.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, place all the beans in a colander and rinse under cold running water. Drain well.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes, chipotle and water and crumble the stock cube over it. Crush the tomatoes into pieces with a wooden spoon. Add the beans, chocolate and sugar, bring to the boil and simmer over low heat for 90 minutes with the lid on the pan. Stir occasionally. Season the chili with pepper and salt if necessary.</li>
    </ol>
